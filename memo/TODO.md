### 3/13
* Focused on Prefixspan and parser and almost forgot what I did with melody line segment part
#### In this part
* array for storing treble notes, array for storing bass notes, words lists and a parameter should be input
* output should be a segmented notes array hopefully (?)
#### Tomorrow (if have time)
* confirm the input and output
* use prefixspan python to segment
